# aho-corasick-and-MSW-Algorithms
This repo is about my degree thesis. 
I implemented a classic <b>Aho Corasick</b> and a new <b>multi pattern search</b> algorithm called MSW (Martin - Seroussi - Weinberger).
After that I worked hard testing both algorithm over several corpus in differents computers and OS.
Finally I compared both algorithms depending on pattern length, pattern's set size and text size.
We found some scenarios where MSW is more efficient than the classic Aho Corasick algorithm, this scenarios are reached when the pattern's set size is enough big and the patterns average length is relatively small.
